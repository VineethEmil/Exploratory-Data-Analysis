# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
A short analysis to practice Exploratory Data Analysis syntaxes in python

The goal of this project is to showcase the application of skills in EDA in a real life business scenario. This particular project also helps in developing ones understanding of risk analytics in **banking and financial services** to understand the importance of using analytics techniques to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to various types of customers.

**Project Understanding**

You are given a dataset from a loan providing company that finds it hard to lend money to people due to their insufficient or even non-existent credit history. Many customers use this to their advantage and become a defaulter causing huge losses to the bank. The company has approached you to give it insights on how to approach which customers and ensure only genuine customers get the loans.

**Business Understanding**

when the company receives a loan application, it has to decide for loan approval based on the information provided by the applicant. This practice involves two types of risks for the company.
1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not providing the loan leads to a loss in business to the company.
2. If the applicant is not likely to pay the loan, then approving the loan would lead to financial loss.

The excel sheet provided contains the information about the loan applications at the time of applying for the loan. There are two types of scenarios listed in the dataset.

1. The client with payment difficulties: They have had a late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample.
2. All other cases: The clients where all the payments are made on time.


There are four types of decisions to be taken in this context:
1. Approved: the company has approved the loan application.
2. Cancelled: The client chose to cancel the application at some point before the loan could be processed by the company.
3. Refused: the company has rejected the loan application.
4. Unused offer: The company has approved the loan application but the client has rejected the offer.

You are expected to use EDA methods to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.

**Business Objectives**

This project aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their instalments. This information can be used to derive insights to take actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending at a higher interest rate etc.. Thus ensuring that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

The aim is to figure out the driving factors behind loan defaults. This information can be used in risk assesment.
